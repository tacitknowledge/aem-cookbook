      # Builds a portion of the search criteria for finding related AEM nodes in Chef server.
      #
      # The old way required a role, and assumed a search criteria that started with "role:#{role}".
      # This now also supports role with a value of "role[<role_name>]" or "recipe[recipe_name]" as
      # well. Chef requires the brackets to be escaped with a backslash, but that's not required
      # in the parameter (this module takes care of that).

        # role == 'role[dispatcher]' will get converted to 'role\[dispatcher\]'
        # Values without brackets will remain unchanged.
        # For future reference, lucene has the following special characters (which all must be escaped):
        # + - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \
